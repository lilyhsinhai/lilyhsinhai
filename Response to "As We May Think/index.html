With the relatively recent technological advances such as warplanes and nuclear weapons, it can be assumed that the scientists behind these inventions (and consequentially all scientists) would be celebrated by the American public, leading many regular people to consider the endless possibilities of technology.</h2>

However the reason for these predictions holding a vague semblance of reality is because many more people, not just scientists, were considering future possibilities and sharing them with one another. I think this article will continue to be relevant well into the future as more and more of our former sci-fi fantasies become a part of our everyday lives.</h2>
